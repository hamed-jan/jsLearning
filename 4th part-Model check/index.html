            There are many ways to define business development. 
            The business development in our company consists of two parts: 
            lead generation and business partnership development or channel partner development. 
                Lead generation: 
                    attracting prospects to become our customers to purchase our products and services.
                Business Partnership Development or Channel Partner Development:
                    Development of partners, such as resellers, value-added resellers (VARs), 
                    systems integrators, technology consulting companies, distributors, 
                    to market and sell our products and services.
